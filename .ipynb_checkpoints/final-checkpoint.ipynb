   "source": [
    "In the telecommunications industry, retaining existing customers is a major challenge due to high competition and the ease with which customers can switch service providers. Customer churn — when customers stop using a company’s services — leads to significant revenue loss and increased costs associated with acquiring new customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Telecom companies collect large amounts of customer data, including usage patterns, service subscriptions, and billing information. This data can be analyzed using machine learning techniques to identify patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem addressed in this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on available telecom customer data. By accurately identifying customers who are at risk of leaving, the company can take proactive measures such as targeted promotions or improved services to reduce churn and improve customer retention."

    "| Decision Tree | 0.90 | 0.65 | 0.72 | 0.69 | Good balance between recall and precision; interpretable; suitable for proactive retention. |\n",
    "| Random Forest | 0.92 | 0.91 | 0.53 | 0.67 | High precision → fewer false positives; lower recall → misses many churners; excellent overall accuracy. |\n",

    "### 2. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recall is crucial**: Detecting as many churners as possible is key for retention; threshold-adjusted Random Forest achieves the highest recall (0.78).  \n",
    "- **Precision controls costs**: High precision reduces unnecessary retention offers; Random Forest without threshold is very conservative (0.91 precision) but misses many churners.  \n",
    "- **F1-score balances both**: Threshold-adjusted Random Forest has the highest F1 (0.74), providing the best overall trade-off.  \n",
    "- **Interpretability vs Performance**: Decision Tree is slightly lower in F1 (0.69) but highly interpretable, making it easier to explain to stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Best model for business objective (maximizing churn detection while limiting false positives):** **Random Forest with threshold 0.3**.  \n",
    "- **Best model for interpretability:** **Decision Tree** — slightly lower F1 but easy to explain decisions.  \n",
    "- **Logistic Regression** is not recommended due to low precision and F1.  \n",
    "- **Standard Random Forest** is too conservative without threshold adjustment, missing too many churners.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "After evaluating multiple models—Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Random Forest with threshold adjustment—the **Random Forest with a threshold of 0.3** is the best model. It provides the highest balance between recall (0.78) and precision (0.70) for churners, resulting in the highest F1-score (0.74). This makes it the most effective model for detecting potential churners while controlling false positives, aligning with the business goal of proactive customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Deploy the Random Forest (Threshold 0.3) model** for churn prediction.  \n",
    "2. **Focus retention efforts on high-risk customers** identified by the model, prioritizing those with high predicted churn probability.  \n",
    "3. **Monitor model performance regularly** and retrain with new customer data to maintain accuracy.  \n",
    "4. **Adjust thresholds as needed** to optimize recall or precision based on changing business priorities or retention budgets.  \n",
    "5. **Use insights from key features** (e.g., `customer service calls`, `international plan`, `total day minutes`) to guide targeted marketing and retention campaigns.  \n",
    "6. **Address class imbalance in future modeling** with techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weighting to improve churn detection.\n"
